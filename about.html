   <p class="line1">As an aspiring IT Consultant/Specialist, I undertook this course on programming to equip me with the required technical skills as a programmer and to learn how to use and apply them in not only a class environment, but in any environment that may require my initiative as a web/mobile developer and also various skills I will have acquired at Moringa School. Such skills acquired are flexibility and adaptation to different social classes as well as working environments and/or situations, initiative and public speaking which are majorly emphasized on at Moringa School, diversity through different and new games, ideas and talks by fellow students and speakers from all round, and punctuality. These skills, combined with my background education in CPA at Strathmore University, build a strong foundation to future career opportunities varying from IT Consultant, Information Systems Auditor, Forensic Accontant, Business Analyst, Strategy Management Analyst/Consultant among others, all of which have my major interest. This is why the programming course at Moringa is not only an additional skill to CV in future, but also a crucial step in developing my career and achieving my long term goals.</p>
